# CodeClauseInternship_Animal_Species_Prediction

Creating an animal species prediction model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) involves several steps. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks like this. 

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather a large dataset of images of different animal species. This dataset should be well-labeled, with each image associated with the correct species label.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resize all the images to a uniform size to ensure consistency.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A common split is 70-80% for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing.

3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - To improve model generalization, apply data augmentation techniques like random rotations, flips, and zooms to the training images. This increases the diversity of training data.

4. **Model Architecture**:
   - Design the CNN architecture. This typically involves stacking multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and then fully connected layers at the end.
   - You can use pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, Inception) as a starting point and fine-tune them for your specific task. This is known as transfer learning.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Initialize the model with random weights or use pre-trained weights (if using transfer learning).
   - Train the model using the training data and validate it using the validation data.
   - Choose an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy).
   - Monitor training progress with metrics like accuracy and loss. Stop training when the model starts to overfit the training data.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and architecture choices to find the best-performing model.

7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the final model on the test dataset to assess its generalization performance.

8. **Model Deployment**:
   - Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for inference. This could be as a web application, mobile app, or any other platform suitable for your use case.


Finally we were able to predict animals based given upon labels.
